		<h1>Briards</h1>
		<p class="credits">by Luke Ashton-Johnson</p>
		<p class="intro">The <a class="breed" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Briard">briard</a>, or berger de brie, is a large breed of dog traditionally used as a herder and guardian of sheep.</p>
		<h2>Breed History</h2>
		<p>The briard, which is believed to have originated in France, has been bred for centuries to herd and to protect sheep. The breed was used by the French Army as sentries, messengers and to search for wounded soldiers because of its fine sense of hearing. Briards were used in the First World War almost to the point of extinction. Currently the population of briards is slowly recovering. Charlemagne, Napoleon, Thomas Jefferson and Lafayette all owned briards.</p>

	font-size
	===========

	The font-size property enables you to specify a size for the font.
	There are several ways to specify the size of a font.
	The most common are:

	Pixels
	======
	Pixels are commonly used because they allow web designers very precise 
	control over how much space their text takes up.

	The number of pixels is followed by the letters px.

	Percentages
	===========
	The default size of text in browsers is 16px.
	So a size of 75% would equivalent of 12px, and 200% would be 32px.

	EMS
	===
	An em is equivalent to the width of a letter m.
